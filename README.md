# Conlang

Note, we need a name for our conlang.

# How to Open the Dictionary

Open Dictionary.py
Run Dictionary.py (This makes sure the file is loaded in properly)
Type the following commands into the terminal:

      python3
      from Dictionary import *

This should open up the dictionary. For now it is only available through the terminal.
Eventually it will be able to be run through an actual interface you can interact with,
but I'm still working on that.
